# The Movie-Hub
 - This aplication is made using ReactJs
 - For movie data I have used OMDB API and use axios to fetch data from OMDB API
 - Used styled-components library from npm for effectively styling and responsiveness
 - Their is a search functionality in app where we can search for our favourite movie app
 - Used the concept of debouncing in search functionality for effective api fetch and fast load response
 - We can see movie details like year, director,genre etc. by clicking on movie card
